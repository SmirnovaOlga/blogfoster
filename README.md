#How to review

1. You need to install node.js , gulp globally and bower globally, if you don't have them.
2. Run `npm install` from project directory (this will also run `bower install` as a post-install script).
3. Open file app/index.html in your browser.
4. For development you could use `gulp watch` which will run SASS watcher.
